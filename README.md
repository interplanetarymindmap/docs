# InterPlanetary Mind Map

**An exploration to understand the primitives of information so we can build tools that allow us to transcend the limitations of our personal and collective minds.**

*This project is in a very early stage of development, so almost everything you can find in this site is considered work-in-progress, and yes, probably most will not make sense yet, but it’s ok. Ask directly about the specifics you want to know more. We invite you to participate. Any comment, suggestion or commit will be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance. :-)*
