# Interplanetary mind-map

Hey, we're concentrating content in this page.

For the time-being you probably want to check this repos:

## What

> Is an exploration to understand the primitives of information so we can build tools that allow us to transcend the limitations of our personal and collective minds.

## Why

It started by asking simple very simple questions...

> Why I'm not notified if the random person next to me is also obsessed with distributed personal knowledge databases?

> Why do I need to embark on an eternal quest of searching, processing and filtering information every time I look for something if I have a friend that is an expert on the subject and has already filtered it for me?

> Why I can't link two arbitrary pieces of information regardless of their format or file-system?

> Why I can't create a digital map of my understanding of the world without being constrained by where the data is stored, what format it has or the tool to manage it?

> Why I can't easily swap **any** interface, so the data is presented in a way that is more digestible for my personal needs

> Why I can't share any random piece of information using any authentication logic I please?

...

## How

The ultimate reasons for why these questions do not have a satisfying answer are complex, but they can be probably separated into two groups:

- Humans playing finite games and not pursuing a long term collective future.
- Unexising or immature technology, probably not fully developed because of the first reason.

The previous understanding meant that we had to start playing an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games).

A game of exploration and understanding, that is not going to finish at any conceivable time, but that can potentially bring great benefits on how humans organize, express and relate to each other.

Because in the end, everything we do, think or feel is because of information.
