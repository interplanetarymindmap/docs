*Collection of ideas and thoughts to establish a conceptual framework to discuss the reasons that lead us to start this project.*

<br><br><br>

## Context

1. **Technology** is everywhere and has dramatically changed landscapes and societies. <small>[[1]](#footnote1)</small>

2. Everything is **energy** <small>[[2]](#footnote2)</small> and energy is **information** in its purest sense. <small>[[3]](#footnote3)</small> The brain receives information and translates into a picture called reality.

<br><br><br>

## Frustrations

1. We are at the Age of **Information**, which is not the same to say that we are living in the Age of **Understanding**. <small>[[11]](#footnote11)</small> Information has no meaning by itself. 

2. Brevity in communication is becoming a problem. The quest for being more efficient in an **individual** level, energy wise, is creating a deficit on the same quest from a **collective** perspective. <small>[[4]](#footnote4)</small> But at the same time, “energy and resource **efficiency** is vital at the level of society and the biosphere”. <small>[[5]](#footnote5)</small>

3. "Intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour […] Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever **more efficient tools to distribute information** is being invented. […] it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age." <small>[[6]](#footnote6)</small>

4. Anybody with a device connected to the internet have the possibility to share a subjective point of view of any topic. We don’t have the necessary tools to process all this **massive amount of information** directly, so we access to it through information retrieval systems that help us **filtering** the sign from the noise. The corporations acting as intermediaries have an agenda. <small>[[7]](#footnote7)</small>

5. The **data** you generate online (from mere traces of your navigation history to content created voluntary) **has value**. It is collected and generally used to sell you products and services. This creates a marketplace where you are the product. **You don’t own your data**. <small>[[8]](#footnote8)</small><small>[[9]](#footnote9)</small><small>[[10]](#footnote10)</small>

Questions we ask to ourselves, pointing to ideas to explore:

- Why I'm not notified if the random person next to me is also obsessed with distributed personal knowledge databases?
    > making real human-to-human connections in the digital word or using digital technologies
- Why do I need to embark on an eternal quest of searching, processing and filtering information every time I look for something if I have a friend that is an expert on the subject and has already filtered it for me?
    > filtering via curated lists
- Why I can't link two arbitrary pieces of information regardless of their format or file-system?
    > connecting any piece of information
- Why I can't create a digital map of my understanding of the world without being constrained by where the data is stored, what format it has or the tool to manage it?
    > digital map of understanding as an expansion of our brain
- Why I can't easily swap **any** interface, so the data is presented in a way that is more digestible for my personal needs?
    > different renders (or interfaces) for the same information
- Why I can't share any random piece of information using any authentication logic I please?
    > identity

The ultimate reasons for why these questions do not have a satisfying answer are complex, but they can be probably separated into two groups:

- Humans playing finite games and not pursuing a long term collective future.
- Unexising or immature technology, probably not fully developed because of the first reason.

The previous understanding meant that we had to start playing an [infinite game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_and_Infinite_Games).

A game of exploration and understanding, that is not going to finish at any conceivable time, but that can potentially bring great benefits on how humans organize, express and relate to each other.

**In the end, everything we do, think or feel is because of information.**

Atoms are not solid, in fact, they have three different subatomic particles inside them: protons, neutrons, and electrons. […] And, as everything is made of atoms, which are energy, this shows us that everything is made up of energy." <small>[source](https://www.learning-mind.com/everything-is-energy/)</small>

[…] Morpheus is trying to get across to Neo that everything he thinks is real is actually only information that the brain receives and translates into a picture called reality. Amazingly, scientists are beginning to think the same way—understanding that energy is everything and energy is information in its purest sense. <small>[source](https://www.consciouslifestylemag.com/everything-is-energy-illusion-reality/)</small>

<b id="footnote4">[4]</b> "The very glut of information now available puts a premium on brevity. Brevity leads to abbreviation. Abbreviation leaves out what is unfamiliar. When you have many facts to digest and lots of phone calls to return, the natural desire is to make each information-processing event as concise as possible. Unfortunately, abbreviated information often provides a poor foundation for understanding. The deeper and richer textures of history are precisely the parts that tend to be edited out in the twenty-five- second sound-bites and misconstrued on CNN. It is much easier to convey a message that is a variation on an already understood theme than it is to explore a new paradigm of understanding. You can report a baseball or a cricket score much more easily than you can explain how baseball or cricket is played and what it means." *James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg “The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age”, p. 279.*

<b id="footnote5">[5]</b> “A strong analogy exists between over/under consumption of energy at the level of the human body and the industrial metabolism of humanity. […] Similarly [with respect to the activity of energy-sensing cellular pathways in people], in a way that is not just analogical but organically and causally linked, energy and resource efficiency is vital at the level of society and the biosphere. […] We propose the concept that a deep parallel connection exists between over/under consumption of energy at the level of the human body and at the level of the biosphere, and that this connection has profound implications for human and environmental health.” *Energy efficiency as a unifying principle for human, environmental, and global health* <small>[source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3869478/)</small>

<b id="footnote7">[7]</b> "Lanier argues that the search for deeper information in any area sooner or later requires that you find information that has been produced by a single person, or a few devoted individuals: "You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning." That is, he sees limitations in the utility of an encyclopedia produced by only partially interested third parties as a form of communication." <small>[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier)</small>

<b id="footnote8">[8]</b> "In his book Who Owns the Future? (2013), Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services, firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms “Siren Servers,” alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool, the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example, he points to Google’s translation algorithm, which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online, giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work, while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. In another example, Lanier points out that in 1988, Kodak employed 140,000 people when it led the digital imaging industry. By 2012, Kodak had filed for bankruptcy due to free photo-sharing sites such as Instagram which employed only 13 people at the time. As a solution to these problems, Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelson’s Project Xanadu. He proposes a two-way linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information, creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web." <small>[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier)</small>
